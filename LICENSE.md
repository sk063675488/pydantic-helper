## About Me

Hello! I’m **Darsh**, the creator of **darsh.fun** — a browser-first platform focused on free online mini-games, productivity tools, and creative web experiences. My goal is simple: to make the web more fun, accessible, and useful for everyone.

At darsh.fun, users can instantly play a variety of mini-games without downloads or sign-ups. The platform includes action, puzzle, sports, and strategy games designed to be lightweight, fast, and enjoyable across devices. Alongside games, I also build practical tools such as calculators, converters, and small utilities that help users solve everyday problems quickly and easily.

I’m passionate about building clean, user-friendly web applications that balance creativity with solid engineering. I enjoy working across the full stack and continuously experiment with new technologies to improve performance, usability, and developer experience. One core belief that guides my work is lowering barriers — tools should feel welcoming, intuitive, and immediately useful.

As I spent more time building real-world applications, I developed a strong interest in developer productivity. Writing backend systems often involves repetitive patterns and boilerplate, especially when working with Python frameworks like FastAPI and libraries such as Pydantic. Remembering exact syntax, validators, and configuration options can slow development and distract from solving real problems.

That experience led to the creation of this **VS Code extension — Pydantic Helper & Snippets**.

This extension is designed to help developers write **modern, correct Pydantic v2 code faster**. It provides practical snippets and command-based helpers for common tasks such as defining models, validators, request and response schemas, and FastAPI endpoints. Everything is aligned with official Pydantic v2 best practices and avoids deprecated APIs.

Just like darsh.fun, this extension follows a few guiding principles: simplicity, correctness, and respect for the developer’s time. There are no hidden behaviors, no telemetry, and no unnecessary complexity. The goal is to reduce friction and let developers focus on building features with confidence.

If this extension helps improve your workflow, thank you for using it. Your support and feedback help drive continued improvements and new tools in the future.
